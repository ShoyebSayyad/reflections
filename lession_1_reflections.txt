How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	diff showed the changes between both the codes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    it would be very efficient as a lot of time would be saved when comparing
    history of the code changes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    we can choose when the commits are meaningfull like a logical change in the
    code and then commit it rather than automatically after a certain time

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	often the code we write affects other supporting files like class files or method
	files so the chanes are also saved to the dependent files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log will give the history of all the commits made to the project and
	git diff gives the changes made between any two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could 
break something?

	it is very good as we can experiment with the code and if a certain commit breaks
	the code we can simply checkout with an older commit.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	i want to create a github profile to display my projects to potential employers.
