Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

clones are used to clone an entire repository which will not have reference to the original repository
forks will have reference to the author who created the repository and can reflect the changes if you hae the access
branches are subject to induvidual repository like branches are inside the repository.
