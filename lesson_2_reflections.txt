What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	it shows that its the master branch and no commits have been made yet.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	staging area allows us to combine files that can be grouped as a
	single commit. it saves us from having to perform induvidual commits on
	all files that we want to be seen as a single commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	in staging area we can add multiple files the use git diff to check the changes 
	and make sure which changes we want to keep and then perform the commit.

	when we want to try out some exprimental changes to the code that we dont want to reflect in the master branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	digrams help us in understanding the flow and structure of git in this case
